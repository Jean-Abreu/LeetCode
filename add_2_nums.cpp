//Problem: Given two non-empty linked lists, created a third linked list representing the sum of each node. 
//The data of the linked list will be stored in reverse order. 

//For this problem, I have not considered using a brute force approach. So far, the solution I have seems to be the best iteration.
//This will need to be tested and confirmed with said future tests.
//But as for the solution, I created a third linked list and store the data as I add, this allows for a single swoop of performance.
//I would say that the time complexity of my solution is O((m or n), depending on which linked list the most nodes.
